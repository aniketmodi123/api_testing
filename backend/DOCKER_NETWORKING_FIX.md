# Docker URL Resolution Fix Summary

## âœ… **FIXED: Docker Networking Issues**

### Problem:

- `runner.py` was getting "All connection attempts failed" errors
- Same Docker networking issues as in `execute_direct.py`
- `localhost` calls failing from inside Docker containers

### Solution Applied:

**Simplified Docker URL Resolution** - Direct replacement approach

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **runner.py**

- âœ… Added `resolve_docker_url()` function
- âœ… Updated HTTP request logic to use resolved URL
- âœ… Simple logic: `localhost` â†’ `host.docker.internal`

#### 2. **execute_direct.py**

- âœ… Simplified `resolve_docker_url()` function
- âœ… Removed complex retry logic with multiple URLs
- âœ… Direct URL replacement approach

### New Logic:

```python
def resolve_docker_url(url: str) -> str:
    """
    When running inside Docker, localhost refers to the host machine.
    """
    if 'localhost' in url:
        return url.replace('localhost', 'host.docker.internal')
    return url
```

### Benefits:

1. **No Extra Tries**: Direct replacement, no multiple attempt loops
2. **Simpler Logic**: Single URL resolution instead of retry mechanisms
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Same fix applied to both runner.py and execute_direct.py
4. **Host Machine Focus**: localhost always means host machine, not Docker internal

### Usage:

- âœ… API calls with `localhost:8003` â†’ `host.docker.internal:8003`
- âœ… Works for both direct execution and run case scenarios
- âœ… No performance overhead from multiple connection attempts

The Docker networking issues should now be resolved for both direct API execution and run case scenarios! ðŸŽ¯
